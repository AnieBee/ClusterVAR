----- Questions Jonas; Meeting January 25th -----

QUESTIONS:
1) Argument "ICType"; Do we still need this? I think the idea was to provide several/all ICs in the output?
>> Anja: IC is used to determine "PrevBestRun" in callEMFuncs, to determine the previous-best-run initialization. 
I now replaced that with the "SC" criterion as a default and removed ICType from the function.
2) Argument "SigmaIncrease"; what is "Sigma" here?
>> Anja: Sigma is the cluster-wise innovation covariance matrix. This is the amount by which the esitmate is increased if the estimate for Sigma becomes close to non-invertible
3) Clarification: how does the rational start (Rational=TRUE) interact with random restarts (Rand=X)? Are the rational starts also random, because K-means is initialized differently?
4) In EMFunc.R you have the if-statement K=1 to speed up things around line 184; but it seems like you execute the more general case already before? It seems like we'd want an if vs. else statement here?
>> Anja:  I think I fixed the progress bar now

5) >> Anja: If we keep the new Lags arbument in the LCVARclust function, good to make clear that it has to be a successive sequence (i.e., that nothing is missing). Because that is how it is used internally. You cannot specify 1 and 3 lags, it will give you 1,2, and 3 lags. I removed "it has to start with 1", because you can also start the sequence at 2, unless you have changed that?


SUGGESTIONS:
1) Output file: I would have a single (heavily nested structure) and avoid any redundancies; but then to make this useable, have a function (maybe "GetModel()" or even S3Method coef() ) to extract the parameters of the desired models; here, arguments should specify the model selection for
2) Structure of Code: Accordingly, I would not do any "best model selection" etc. in callEMFuncs.R, but simply return all models; this also implies that we delete any model selection criteria as inputs in the overall LCVARClust() function
3) The S3methods print(), summary(), and plot() then all make use of repeatedly calling this new coef() function and giving nice summary tables/plots

NOTES:
1) Now I commented out EM warnings in callEMFuncs.R; Let's make sure to still show them as actual warnings using warnings()
>> Anja: Also had to be (and now is removed) in functions: checkLikelihoodsNA, checkOutliers, checkPosteriorsNA, checkSingularitySigma, checkConvergence, checkComponentsCollapsed, calculatePsoterior

2) The progress bar is not fully aligned with the algorithm, and I think this is due to Question (4) above
>> Anja: I think I fixed it now

----- OLD STUFF FROM 2023 -----
-------------------------------

----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING
- Structure the output object more intuitively
    - On the top level there should be
      - Call
        - Copy *full* function call [[done ]]
      - Model selection / ICs for all fitted models
      - Then object with selected model
      - And nested object with all fitted models
    - avoid [[1]] in LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster
    - Make the output vectors "$LogLikelihood" and "EMiterationReset" only as long as many iterations were actually run [[done ]]
- Consider parallelize (e.g., across EM-restarts)
- Consider a simpler progress bar
    - maybe across random restarts
- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing

2. S3 Methods
- print for LCVARclust incl model selection
- summary for LCVARclust incl model selection function
- plot for new model selection function

3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]


----- Questions -----

1. How does the data handle missing data / unequal time steps? I think there is no input arguments for things like "days" and "measurement occasion per day"? Are those two things together coded in the argument "Time"?
>> Time is really just each time-point after one another, missing data is not facilitated so Time should be a sequence of integers without missings.

2. Why use "invisible()" instead of "return()" to return objects from functions?
>> I like it because it does not print stuff to the screen unless you save it somewhere, just a weird preference I have.

3. Why is the object LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster a list with 1 entry, if all the cluster info is in this list entry? (I guess we already notes this last time, see above); I tried to get rid of this in callEMFuncs.R, but didn't manage
>> So LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster is the result of the grid search over all solutions that shows the signle best model (best start and best time-series model) for a given number of clusters. There is only 1 entry in this because you specified in your example only 1 number of clusters. If you specify a vector of possible number of clusters in the LCVARclust input (e.g., 2:4) you will get 3 entries here (the best fitting model for 2-clusters, the best fitting model for 3-clusters, and the best fitting model for 4-clusters). The best model for a given number of clusters is slected though the time-series information criterion (e.g., either HQ or SC).

4. What is the rational EM-start? Some mean-based clustering or so?
>> Yes, basically a k-means result where the parameters of the time-series model we entered into the k-means algorithm.

5. Anja: how do you ensure a function form the correct package is called? Using ::?
