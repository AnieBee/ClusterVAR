----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
- Allow for Cluster=1
- Complete manual; maybe reconsider naming of some arguments; especially output is undocumented
- Consdider parallelize (e.g., across EM-restarts)
- Consider a simpler progress bar
- Consider allowing to search a nCluster sequence; this could also be a wrapper around LCVARclust
- Structure the output object more intuitively
    - hide results of multiple starts somewhere
    - avoid [[1]] in LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster
    - Order
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups

2. S3 Methods
- print for LCVARclust
- summary for LCVARclust
- plot for LCVARclust (if we run sequence of clusters)

3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests


----- Questions -----

1) In the package example, what is in the second matrix "LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster[[1]]$A"? I selected 1 lag, so there should only be 1 VAR matrix?
2)
