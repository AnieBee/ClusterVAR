----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING
- Structure the output object more intuitively
    - On the top level there should be
      - Call
        - Copy *full* function call [[done ]]
      - Model selection / ICs for all fitted models
      - Then object with selected model
      - And nested object with all fitted models
    - avoid [[1]] in LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster
    - Make the output vectors "$LogLikelihood" and "EMiterationReset" only as long as many iterations were actually run [[done ]]
- Consider parallelize (e.g., across EM-restarts)
- Consider a simpler progress bar
    - maybe across random restarts
- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing

2. S3 Methods
- print for LCVARclust incl model selection
- summary for LCVARclust incl model selection function
- plot for new model selection function

3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]


----- Questions -----

1. How does the data handle missing data / unequal time steps? I think there is no input arguments for things like "days" and "measurement occasion per day"? Are those two things together coded in the argument "Time"?
>> Time is really just each time-point after one another, missing data is not facilitated so Time should be a sequence of integers without missings.

2. Why use "invisible()" instead of "return()" to return objects from functions?
>> I like it because it does not print stuff to the screen unless you save it somewhere, just a weird preference I have.

3. Why is the object LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster a list with 1 entry, if all the cluster info is in this list entry? (I guess we already notes this last time, see above); I tried to get rid of this in callEMFuncs.R, but didn't manage
>> So LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster is the result of the grid search over all solutions that shows the signle best model (best start and best time-series model) for a given number of clusters. There is only 1 entry in this because you specified in your example only 1 number of clusters. If you specify a vector of possible number of clusters in the LCVARclust input (e.g., 2:4) you will get 3 entries here (the best fitting model for 2-clusters, the best fitting model for 3-clusters, and the best fitting model for 4-clusters). The best model for a given number of clusters is slected though the time-series information criterion (e.g., either HQ or SC).

4. What is the rational EM-start? Some mean-based clustering or so?
>> Yes, basically a k-means result where the parameters of the time-series model we entered into the k-means algorithm.

5. Anja: how do you ensure a function form the correct package is called? Using ::?
