----- Questions -----

1. Discuss the estimation of daytime-effects when day is specified.

2. Do we have a plotting function for the coefficients?

3. What was the code again for compiling the package?

4. Plot function that plots IC needs to be updated in line with updates to summary, if show = "BPC" can plot the number of parameters, becuase the TS IC and the log-likelihood IC cannot be used for comparison


5. Anja: how do you ensure a function form the correct package is called? Using ::?




-------------------------------
----- OLD STUFF FROM 2023 -----
-------------------------------

----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING

- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing


3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]
