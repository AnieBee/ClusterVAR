----- Questions -----

1. Discuss the estimation of daytime-effects when day is specified.

2. Do we have a plotting function for the coefficients?

4. What is the rational EM-start? Some mean-based clustering or so?
>> Yes, basically a k-means result where the parameters of the time-series model we entered into the k-means algorithm.

5. Anja: how do you ensure a function form the correct package is called? Using ::?

----- OLD STUFF FROM 2023 -----
-------------------------------

----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING

- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing


3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]
