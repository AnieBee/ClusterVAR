----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Make extra function that does model selection on grid 1:K & 1:maxLag + nice outputs
  -> Jonas: I made a first stab at this, but no function yet

POLISHING
- Complete manual; maybe reconsider naming of some arguments; especially output is undocumented (Intercept should maybe be renamed within-person mean to make it more clear)
- Structure the output object more intuitively
    - hide results of multiple starts somewhere
    - avoid [[1]] in LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster
    - Consider: Have on a first "level" global statistics, like convergence etc; and on next level the separate cluster-models in a list
    - Copy full function call
- Consider parallelize (e.g., across EM-restarts)
- Consider a simpler progress bar
    - maybe across random restarts


Anja:
- Add information criteria that are considering all model parameters and not just difference in lag order
- Return more information criteria, possibly include that in the ModelSummaryLCVAR function rather than in the LCVARclust function


2. S3 Methods
- print for LCVARclust
- summary for LCVARclust
- plot for LCVARclust (if we run sequence of clusters)

3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]



----- Questions -----
1. How does the data handle missing data / unequal time steps? I think there is no input arguments for things like "days" and "measurement occasion per day"? Are those two things together coded in the argument "Time"?
2. Why not use BIC for model comparison between different numbers of cluster K? E.g., this is being done in model selection in GMMs; Implemented this now (trivial ofc) and seems to work at least for the synthetic example data in the package
3. Why use "invisible()" instead of "return()" to return objects from functions?
4. Why is the object LCVAR_out$BestSolutionsPerCluster a list with 1 entry, if all the cluster info is in this list entry? (I guess we already notes this last time, see above); I tried to get rid of this in callEMFuncs.R, but didn't manage
5. What is the rational EM-start? Some mean-based clustering or so?
