----- Questions -----

1A. Plot function that plots IC needs to be updated in line with updates to summary, if show = "BPC", the plot function can plot the number of parameters, becuase the TS IC and the log-likelihood IC cannot be used for comparison
>> what shall be default of summary function? GNL or BPC?
>> I made the default option for GNL, shall it be same default for GNC? Maybe highest number of clusters?

1. Plot should plot Nparas for BPC

2. Code snippet to compile package

3. I made the function parallel, does slow it down though if there is only one cluster
>> how to remove the text that it prints?
>> The progress bar does not work anymore, jumps between higher and lower numbers (when lags 1:2 and clusters 1:5). 
I think we have to move it outside of the cluster calculations then, then it can only be updated with the number of clusters
>> add the three necessary pacakges for foreach to namespace

----- OLD STUFF FROM 2023 -----
-------------------------------

----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING

- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing


3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]
