----- Questions -----

1. parallel function
>> how to make it work
>> how to remove the text that it prints?
>> The progress bar does not work anymore, jumps between higher and lower numbers (when lags 1:2 and clusters 1:5). 
I
1A. Plot function 
>> color to distinguish 
>> inlcude the non-difference option for non lag 1 models as well
>> Plot should plot Nparas for BPC

4. Should we add the option to within-person center the data?

----- OLD STUFF FROM 2023 -----

----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING

- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing


3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]
