3. I made the function parallel, does slow it down though if there is only one cluster
>> I fixed replication (set seed) as far as I can see, let's monitor
>> how to remove the text that it prints?
>> The progress bar does not work anymore, jumps between higher and lower numbers (when lags 1:2 and clusters 1:5). 
I think we have to move it outside of the cluster calculations then, then it can only be updated with the number of clusters
>> add the three necessary pacakges for foreach to namespace
>> Did you ever use this in a pacakge? Are we sure this will work on other people's computer?

1A. Plot function that plots IC needs to be updated in line with updates to summary, if show = "BPC", the plot function can plot the number of parameters, becuase the TS IC and the log-likelihood IC cannot be used for comparison
>> what shall be default of summary function? GNL or BPC?
>> I made the default option for GNL, shall it be same default for GNC? Maybe highest number of clusters?
>> Plot should plot Nparas for BPC

4. Should we add the option to within-person center the data?

----- OLD STUFF FROM 2023 -----
-------------------------------

----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING

- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing


3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]
