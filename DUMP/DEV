----- Questions -----

1. parallel function
>> The progress bar does not work anymore, jumps between higher and lower numbers (when lags 1:2 and clusters 1:5). 
>> Update that LCVAR has to specify the nubmer of cores



2. Plot function 
>> Check mail questions all implemented
>> Heading for "GNL" should not be "Fixed max lag" but "Fixed lag"


3. Manuals
>> I think some functions still don't have the manual function coef() and numberPredictableObservations
>>

----- OLD STUFF FROM 2023 -----

----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING

- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing


3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]
