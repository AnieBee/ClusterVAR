----- Questions -----

1. parallel function
>> how to make it work 
>> how to remove the text that it prints?
>> The progress bar does not work anymore, jumps between higher and lower numbers (when lags 1:2 and clusters 1:5). 



2. Plot function 
>> If plotting Number of clusters, the x axis somtimes shows non-integer values (like, 0.8), would be good if x axis was drawn specifically as using the cluster numbers in that range (e.g., use the output elelent to see what the cluster range was that was specified)
This happens for show = "BPC", and show = "GNL",
>> After using plot(LCVAR_outExample2, show = "specific", Model = c(1, 1)) the plotting environment continues to be split in 2
>> the names are X, but X in our notation is for exogenous variabes, these are endogenous variables which we denote as Y, so should at least be called Y but it would be best if the names of the variables would be passed on
>> color to distinguish large and small coefficients (include white for values that are close to zero)
>> inlcude the non-difference option for non lag 1 models as well
>> Plot should plot Nparas for BPC

3. Manuals
>> I think some functions still don't have the manual function coef()

----- OLD STUFF FROM 2023 -----
-------------------------------

----- Ideas for development -----

1. LCVARclust
KEY THINGS
- Jonas: Think about S3 methods to present this nicer; look into how other packages (e.g., mclust) did this
- Anja: When making the documentation add default values in the LCVARclust function (e.g., for ICType)


POLISHING

- Complete manual
    - some explanations missing, e.g. what Rational starts are
    - Description of output missing


3. Add a Vignette
- Fit cluster=2 model
- Visualize different parameters (with native and other functions, e.g. qgraph)
- Do model selection across Ncluster sequence

4. Add unit tests

5. Things parked for (much) later
- Potentially get Standard errors for parameters, to be able to test differences in specific parameters across specific groups [After last meeting: still has to be figured out]
